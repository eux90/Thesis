# Thesis
My thesis developed in collaboration with Leonardo Aircraft Division

The thesis activity has involved the design of an IOS based on web technologies, from collection of requirements up to the development of a working prototype. Django (a Python web framework) was used for the back-end, together with WebSockets to manage data streams. The front-end relies on Bootstrap to offer a responsive interface, compatible with both tablets an desktop platforms. (Source Code is property of Leonardo AD and cannot be shared)
